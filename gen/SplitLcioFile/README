The scripts work as a file splitter to make small fractions of files
so that we can process in parallel.

How to use:
Edit conf.py.
python main.py          // This creates steering files.
source init_ilcsoft.sh  // Marlin is required.
python manyrun.py       // This processes the steering files above.
